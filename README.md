# Inventory Management System (Frontend)

This is a simple web-based **Inventory Management System** built using **HTML**, **CSS (TailwindCSS)**, and **JavaScript**. This is the **frontend part** of the system, which allows users to manage inventory, make sales, upload documents, and manage suppliers.

> **Note**: This is the frontend-only implementation. For a complete system, you will need to integrate this with a backend (for data storage, user management, etc.).

## Features

- **Dashboard**: View the overall statistics and manage the inventory.
- **Inventory**: Add, update, and manage products in the inventory.
- **Sales**: Record sales and update the inventory automatically.
- **Supplier Management**: Add and view suppliers for the products.
- **Report**: Generate and view sales reports.
- **Document Management**: Upload, manage, and view documents related to the business.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes using **TailwindCSS**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS (TailwindCSS)**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic content (e.g., adding products, handling sales, uploading documents).
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in the user interface.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the application in action.

> **Note:** Since this is the frontend part of the system, there is no backend to handle data. You will need to implement a backend (e.g., with Node.js, PHP, Python) to handle database operations for things like storing inventory data, sales records, and supplier information.

## How to Use

- **Add Inventory**: Click on the "Add Product" button in the Inventory section to add new products to your inventory.
- **Sell Products**: In the Sales section, click the "Sell" button for any product, input the quantity to sell, and confirm the sale. The inventory will automatically be updated.
- **Upload Documents**: In the Document Management section, click "Upload Document" to upload any relevant documents for your business.
- **View Reports**: View your sales and inventory reports to analyze business performance.
